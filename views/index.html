The energy galaxy is a network of connections between people that interact with each other about energy issues that affect their every-day lives. Your energy network includes the people who you talk to regarding electricity, natural gas, oil, solar, wind, nuclear, fuel efficiency, electric vehicles, and so on. For example, this could range from talking to your neighbor about home efficiency improvements to talking to your car dealer about fuel economy. By filling out this survey, you can see your place in the Energy Galaxy, and how your network is connected. The more information you provide, the more detail you will see in your network when you are finished. Your contact information will not be shared with any third parties.
